Description : This Python script is designed to perform a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing credit card information. It starts by importing key librariesâ€”Pandas for data handling, Seaborn for statistical visualization, and Matplotlib for plot customization. The dataset is loaded from a CSV file, after which it undergoes basic cleaning: account opening dates are converted to datetime format, and invalid or missing entries are removed to ensure the integrity of the visual insights. A new column is created to extract the year from the account opening date, allowing for time-based trend analysis. The script then sets up a 2x3 grid layout of subplots, generating six distinct visualizations.
                   These include: a bar plot showing card brand distribution, a grouped bar plot comparing card types across brands, a bar chart comparing chip-enabled versus non-chip cards by card type, a time series bar plot tracking the number of accounts opened each year, a box plot analyzing the distribution of credit limits across card types, and a scatter plot exploring the relationship between the number of cards issued and the associated credit limits. Each visualization is customized with titles, axis labels, color palettes, and layout adjustments to enhance clarity and readability. Together, these plots provide a multifaceted view of the credit card data, enabling users to detect trends, compare categories, identify outliers, and better understand customer behavior and product characteristics.
                   This kind of analysis is valuable for financial institutions, analysts, and decision-makers looking to derive meaningful insights from card usage patterns and credit trends.
